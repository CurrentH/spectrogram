#	To get this program working we need to patch sox.
#	https://sourceforge.net/p/sox/mailman/message/34779977/
#	The patch is attached to the message.
#
#	The source code for Sox can be found at
#	http://sox.sourceforge.net/
#	
#	There have been made a few changes to the INSTALL file 
#	that follows the source code when compiling sox.
#	Its mainly for easier use. The 'new' INSTALL file
#	lies on the master branch of this repository,
#	in the /src/ folder.
